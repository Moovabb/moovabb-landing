# MOOVAB Landing Page

A clean, fast landing page scaffold built with Tailwind CSS and plain HTML, ready for GitHub Pages.

## Scripts
- `npm run build` — build CSS once to `dist/output.css`
- `npm run watch` — watch CSS during development
- `npm run build:prod` — build and minify for production

## Development
1. Install deps: `npm install`
2. Start watcher: `npm run watch`
3. Open `index.html` in your browser (or use a simple static server)

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
- Commit the repository and push to GitHub.
- Enable GitHub Pages on the `main` branch (root).
- Ensure `dist/output.css` is present in the repo (run `npm run build:prod` before committing).
